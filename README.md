Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, holding 85% of global market share. That makes Android the natural starting point for new app developers. This series of courses teaches the basics needed to develop, design, manage, and distribute a native Android application using the Kotlin programming language and the Android SDK. Part 1 covers setting up your development environment—on Mac or Windows—including Android Studio and the physical or virtual devices you'll need for testing. Instructor Annyce Davis then explores the structure of a typical Android app as well as the build files, dependencies (external code and libraries used in your project), and prebuilt components available from third-party providers like Jetpack. In the fourth chapter, she pivots to active development, demonstrating how to define the screens of your user interface using activities, XML layouts, and Views. Make sure to take the challenges throughout the course to practice your new skills.

## Learning Objectives
- Setting up Android Studio on Mac and Windows
- Creating virtual devices for testing
- Exploring the project structure
- Using dependencies
- Troubleshooting projects
- Defining screens with activities
- Implementing designs in XML layouts
- Displaying Views in ViewGroups

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop-up menu in GitHub to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add "/tree/BRANCH_NAME" to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is CHAPTER_VIDEO.  As an example, the branch named "02_03" corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters "b" for "beginning" and "e" for "end". The "b" branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the video. The "e" branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The master branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Android Studio
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like Sourcetree.
